# Predicting-Gold-Prices-ML 
The price of gold has always played a key role in the financial market since it is considered to be a hedge by investors against many unprecedented events. 
This work aims to predict the gold price return over the short- and long-term horizon. 
We have applied Catboost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and SVR to forecast the gold price. 
In addition, we aim to understand the gold price movement relative to its base price over the 1- and 12-month horizon. 
For that classification problem, we applied SVM and ANN.
